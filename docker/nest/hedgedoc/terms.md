# Terms of service for `notepad.lorebooks.wiki`

_**Last updated**: 2024-09-20 ([commit history])_

Andrei Jiroh Halili of RecapTime.dev operates this [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org) instance on [Hack Club Nest](https://hackclub.app) not only for note-taking by Hack Clubbers and Recap Time Squad team members but as a public service.

By using this service, you agree to both [RecapTime.dev Community Code of Conduct](https://policies.recptime.dev/code-of-conduct) and [lorebooks.wiki hosting terms of service](https://lorebooks.wiki/legal/tos) as well as [Hack Club Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct) and [Nest Acceptable Use Policy](https://guides.hackclub.app/index.php/Acceptable_Use_Policy).

## Reporting abuse

For code of conduct violations, reach out to [Andrei Jiroh](https://andreijiroh.dev/contact) first before pinging the `@fire-fighters` of Hack Club Slack (we don't want false postive reports being spammed when CCing `conduct@hackclub.com`)
